**Cannot see POSIX attributes from Active Directory via IPA-AD trust**
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2536681

ID MAPPING
By default, the AD provider will map UID and GID values from the objectSID parameter in Active Directory. For details on this, see the “ID MAPPING” section below. If you want to disable ID mapping and instead rely on POSIX attributes defined in Active Directory, you should set ldap_id_mapping = False

If POSIX attributes should be used, it is recommended for performance reasons that the attributes are also replicated to the Global Catalog. If POSIX attributes are replicated, SSSD will attempt to locate the domain of a requested numerical ID with the help of the Global Catalog and only search that domain. In contrast, if POSIX attributes are not replicated to the Global Catalog, SSSD must search all the domains in the forest sequentially. Please note that that the “cache_first” option might be also helpful in speeding up domainless searches.

Users, groups and other entities served by SSSD are always treated as case-insensitive in the AD provider for compatibility with Active Directory's LDAP implementation.
